# Style-Preserving Image Translation from Korean to English
Style-Preserving Image Translation from Korean to English

## Introduction
The unique style of the text is an important element of graphic design. The color, font, and texture of each text convey information to the reader. There are well-known translator mobile applications that are capable of doing this; Google translator and Naver Papago for example. But these translators cannot preserve the style of the text at all. This project aims to translate text in the wild, while preserving original text style, especially from Korean to English.
